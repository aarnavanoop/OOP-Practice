SIT232: Object-Oriented Development Portfolio

This repository contains my practical task submissions for SIT232 in which I attained a High Distinction. Each task focuses on fundamental and advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using C# and the .NET Core framework

🛠 Project Breakdown
Phase 1: Programming Fundamentals

1.1P - Selection: Implementation of programs to convert integers (1-9) into words using both if-else and switch statements for input validation.
+1


1.2P - Repetition: A "Guessing Number" game that utilizes do-while loops to ensure player input is validated before checking against the target number.
+1

Phase 2: Introduction to Objects
2.1P - Mobile Program: Designed a Mobile class to simulate a phone account. This introduced instance variables, accessor/mutator methods, and the this keyword.
+3


2.2P - Banking System: Developed an Account class to handle financial transactions (Deposit/Withdraw) while maintaining a private state for the user's balance.
+2


2.3C - MyTime: A complex time-management class built from scratch without native .NET libraries. It handles "rollover" logic (e.g., 23:59:59 transitioning to 00:00:00) and supports method chaining for operations like t.NextHour().NextMinute()

📝 Key Learning Outcomes

Encapsulation: Protecting data by making instance variables private and exposing them through properties or methods.
+1


Validation: Ensuring objects always exist in a valid state (e.g., preventing a MyTime object from having 25 hours).
+2


Logic Flow: Mastering different loop structures to solve various algorithmic problems
